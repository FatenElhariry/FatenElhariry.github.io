#### Introduction 
  - **What is Sentiment Analysis?**
    Sentiment Analysis is used to discover peopleâ€™s opinions, emotions and feelings about a product or service.

    In theory it is a computational study of **opinions, sentiments, attitudes, views, emotions etc**. _expressed in text_. This text can be in a variety of formats like Reviews, Blogs, News or Comments.

    **Alternative names**: _Opinion Mining, Sentiment Mining, and Subjectivity Analysis_.
  - We can broadly divide the problems in sentiment analysis into 3 categories :
    1. Text Polarity refers to identifying sentiment orientation of the text
    2. Sentiment rating gives a numerical rank, say from 1 to 5 for text
    3. Aspect based Sentiment Analysis determines the sentiment towards specific aspects in text.
