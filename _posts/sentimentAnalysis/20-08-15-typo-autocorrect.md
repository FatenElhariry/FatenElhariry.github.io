- What is autocorrect? 
  Autocorrect is an application that changes misspelled words into the correct ones. You probably know it very well already. You have it on your phone, tablet, and on your computer inside your document editors and email applications. For example, it takes a sentence like this one, happy birthday deah friend, and corrects the misspelled word, deah, to a word that you probably intended to write, which in this context would be dear, correctly spelled D-E-A-R. But what if you typed deer instead of dear? Here, you see the word is spelled correctly, but it's context is incorrect. Well
