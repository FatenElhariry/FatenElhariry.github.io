`this a summary for Amazon EC2 Master Class (with Auto Scaling and Load Balancer) course in oreilly library`

### EC2 
  is the most important service in AWS Services it about renting server in the cloud 
  - you can create the instance with wazir in 
  - after that we can use the public DNS to connect to the instance and download the key to use it in login 
  - ssh -i privatekey.pem username@publicip
  - if you are in linux you can add shortcut to the instance in `cat ~/.ssh/config` after that login with the shortcut name 

#### What is the security group? 
  - it used to control and secure the connection from the instance to outside and from outside to the instance 
  - it can be attached to multiple instance 
  - it dedicate to one ragion and one VPC 
  - it is living outside the ES2 instances this mean that the instance will not be able to know about the blocked requests 
  - if your application is not accessible and you get time out almost it is a security group issue 
  - if your application gives you 'connection refused' error &rarr; it is application error or application not launched  
  - by default all inbound connections are blocked and all outside connections are authorized 

#### What is the difference between the Private and public IP?
  - Public IP
    - is identified over the internet www
    - it is unique across the whole web 
    - can be geo-located easily 
  - Private IP 
    - two companies can have the same IP range 
    - the IP must be unique in the private network 
    - can only be identified with the private network 
    - machines can access the public internet through internet gateway (router)
    - there only spesified set of IPs can be used as a private IP 

#### Private and public IP in AWS EC2?
  - by default you EC2 comes with 
    - Private IP for the internal AWS network 
    - public IP for the WWW
    - if you connect to the machine you use the public IP 
    - if you stop and start the machine It can take new IP 
    - but if you inside your machine you can use the private IP to connect to any other machine the network

#### troubleshooting
  - if you have timeout &rarr; you can think about the security group 
    - if you use the public DNS od your machine and try to access it from the web it will give you timeout 
      - you need to add policy to define role for the http ports and enable connection 
    - refuse connection 
      - means that you can access the machine but you didn't run anything in it yet

#### what is AMI ?
  - this the base images like ubuntu, fedora ..etc
  - this image can be configured at the run time
