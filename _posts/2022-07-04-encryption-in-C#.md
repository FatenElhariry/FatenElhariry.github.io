### What is asymmetric encryption?
    Asymmetric encryption uses the notion of a key pair: a different key is used for the encryption and decryption process. One of the keys is typically known as the private key and the other is known as the public key.
    - **The private key** is kept secret by the owner `used to decrypt`
    - **the public key** is either shared amongst authorised recipients or made available to the public at large. `used to encrypt`
      - **RSA Cryptography**
