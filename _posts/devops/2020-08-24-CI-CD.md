here the first touch with ansible

- first I create new instance of EC2 for test demos
- then install ansible in ubuntu
  - `python3 -m pip -V` &rarr; check python version ansd pip version
  - `pip3 install ansible ` &rarr; if it is on the global pip then if it is on the user pip use `python3 -m pip install --upgrade -user pip & python3 -m pip install --user ansible`
  - ` pip3 show ansible` &rarr; show the ansible's version and main configuration details
- after that and to run simple demo we create new folder in the instance

  - create the playbook file `main.yml`
  - create folder called `roles`
  - then subfolder called `print`
  - then subfolder called `tasks`
  - then create the task to print the path for the current working directory
  - so inside the tasks folder create file `main.yml` which conatins

    ```

    - name: Print env variable
        shell: echo $PATH
        register: print_result

    - name: print message
        debug:
        msg: "{{ print_result.stdout_lines }}"
    ```

    - then add code in playbook to run the taks

    ```

    - name: Exercise #1
    hosts: localhost

    roles:
        - print
    ```

##### what is inventory file in ansible and why we need it with playbook
  it is a way to query server and configure it in ansibles 
  - allow you run script to 1000s of servers at the same time 
  - creating the inventory file in ec2 nodes 
  `
  echo "[all]" > inventory
  aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].PublicIpAddress'  --output text >> inventory
  ` 
  - here if you need to run ansible file in the cloud instance and with assumation that inventory file and private key in the same place 
  `ansible-playbook main-remote.yml -i inventory --private-key udacity.pem`
