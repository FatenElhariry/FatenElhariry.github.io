#### What is the main component of AWS? 
  - region 
    is the geographic loation where the service is located in 
  - avaliablity zone 
    it is the data center place
  - edge location (local zone)
    the  location of the content delivery network and where it exactly are 
    - it like the avaliablity zone which is near to the user 
    - it is used for content delivery network cloud front 
    - it is reduce latency, promote website scalability, reduce the load on the server and promote some 
  - there is private network between the edge location service and the server it doesn't depend on the network

#### what is the virtual private network and what is going on ? (VPC)
  - it within AWS data center 
  - use a software layer to create your virtual cloud network (VPC)
  - it is just a virtualized data center that you have 
  - it contains 
    - subnet 
    - routing tables 
    - server 
    - storage
   
#### hyprid cloud 
  if the local data center give as the highest avaliability and help us to avoid letancy 
  - if the cloud provider lock down thier service you will still use you service 

#### VPN & connected line 
  - VPN 
    - when you have a network and you create a private network inside your public network 
    - **so why do we don't send our traffic over the internet?**
      - the internet is not secure 
      - handle routing is much easier to be in the private network to be handled using subnets 
      - also it provide address for us in the private network due to there is no enough address in the internet 
      - it is a virtual private tunnel 

#### types of storage ?
  - bucket storage 
    is used for virtual hard storage 
  - object storage 
    for archive needs 
  - file storage 
    if you have many users used to write and read at the same time     

#### what is the difference between block storage and HHD storage?
  - block storage ensure the avaliability and fault tolerance for the object but it is very slow due to repeats copies  



#### research 
  - ipsec
